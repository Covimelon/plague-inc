Jeremy - I wrote the logistic function simulator in the Experiments folder so that we can develop the Disease class later on more easily.

Jeremy - I imported the map.png image from the data folder onto the background of the sketch window. I also created the City class with its variables and constructor. I created instance variables for each city on the map, and for each, I assigned a particular circle. I also stored the names of adjacent cities in an ArrayList variable in each City and drew lines between each City and its adjacent Cities.
